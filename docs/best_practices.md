# ğŸ§  Best Practices Guide

## 1. Monorepo & Nx Practices

* **Single Source of Truth:** Keep shared logic in libraries under `/libs`, not duplicated across apps.
* **Isolation:** Each app or library should build independently and define clear public APIs.
* **Tagging & Boundaries:** Use `@nx/enforce-module-boundaries` and tags to restrict imports between feature domains.
* **Buildable Libraries:** Use `--buildable` when libraries need to be compiled or reused outside the repo.
* **Consistent Naming:** Follow `domain-feature-type` convention (e.g., `user-profile-ui`).
* **CI Optimization:** Use Nx Cloud or distributed task execution to speed up CI/CD.
* **Version Control:** Commit only source and build config â€” no generated artifacts.

## 2. Angular Frontend Best Practices

* **Change Detection:** Use `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` for performance.
* **Standalone Components:** Prefer standalone over `NgModule` when possible.
* **Signals & Observables:** Use Signals for state, and Observables for streams; avoid mixing without clear conversion.
* **Type Safety:** Always strongly type inputs, outputs, and event emitters.
* **Folder Structure:**

  ```
  feature/
  â”œâ”€ components/
  â”œâ”€ services/
  â”œâ”€ models/
  â”œâ”€ utils/
  â””â”€ feature.routes.ts
  ```
* **Performance:**

  * Lazy load feature routes.
  * Use `trackBy` with `*ngFor` and `@for`.
  * Avoid large data bindings in templates.
* **Accessibility:** Add ARIA labels, alt text, and proper semantic tags.
* **Styling:** Use SCSS and BEM or ITCSS for scalable styles.

## 3. Express Backend Best Practices

* **Routing:**

  * Group routes by domain (`/users`, `/auth`, `/courses`).
  * Use controllers/services separation.
* **Error Handling:** Centralize error middleware.
* **Validation:** Use libraries like `zod` or `joi` for request validation.
* **Security:**

  * Sanitize inputs.
  * Use helmet and rate limiting.
  * Store secrets in environment variables.
* **Logging:** Use a structured logger (e.g., `pino`, `winston`) and separate logs by level.
* **Modularity:** Keep utilities and models reusable under `/libs/backend-utils` or `/libs/shared`.

---

## 4. Code Quality & Collaboration

* **Linting & Formatting:** Enforce with ESLint + Prettier in pre-commit hooks.
* **Testing:**

  * Use Jest for unit tests and Cypress for e2e.
  * Target >80% coverage for critical modules.
* **Code Reviews:** Focus on readability, testability, and adherence to conventions.
* **Git Hygiene:**

  * Small, atomic commits.
  * Descriptive messages using Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`).
* **Documentation:** Every major feature or library should have its own `README.md`.

---

## 5. General Software Engineering Best Practices

* **Separation of Concerns:** UI, business logic, and data access layers should stay independent.
* **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class, function, and component does one thing well.
* **Fail Fast:** Validate early, handle errors gracefully.
* **Scalability:** Favor composition over inheritance; keep APIs modular.
* **Automation:** Use scripts for repetitive tasks (lint, test, build).
* **Continuous Integration:** Automate testing and linting on every pull request.
* **Monitoring:** Track performance metrics and runtime errors in production.

---

## 6. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing

* Store docs in `/docs` or under each libraryâ€™s `/docs` folder.
* Maintain:

  * `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design.
  * `CONTRIBUTING.md` for dev setup.
  * `API_GUIDELINES.md` for backend contracts.
  * `STYLE_GUIDE.md` for code conventions.
* Keep README files concise but informative.

---

## 7. Security & Configuration

* Never commit `.env` files â€” use `.env.example` templates.
* Rotate keys and credentials regularly.
* Keep third-party dependencies updated.
* Enable strict mode in both TypeScript and Angular.
* Use HTTPS and CSP headers in production.

---

## âœ… Summary

This monorepo should emphasize:

* **Consistency** across teams
* **Performance** in Angular and Express
* **Reusability** through Nx libraries
* **Security & Maintainability** as the system scales
